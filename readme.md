# ChatScripts
A self maintained repository for housing Roblox's chat scripts from 2016

# Why?
The Roblox Chat scripts are continued to be maintained by Roblox, however it has many issues which would be easier to fix in a self-hosted repsitory instead of relying on Roblox.

# Instalation
The source is available as a Rojo project and a prebuilt RBXM.

* Method 1: Rojo Project
Copy the source's content into your project (not the folder itself), and sync it to the Chat.

* Method 2: Prebuilt RBXM
Import the RBXM into Studio, then place the folder's contents into Chat
